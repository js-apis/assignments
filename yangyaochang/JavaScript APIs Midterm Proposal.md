## Objective ##

Build a website which shows basic weather and air quality index of specified cities. Users can select a country, a state, and a city one after another.

## How to achieve ##

The API which I am using is 
[AirVisual.](https://www.airvisual.com/air-pollution-data-api)

I make API calls to grab countries name, states name, and cities name which the API has supported and use JavaScript to generate countries buttons, states buttons, and cities button with those names on the web. After users specify the city, the web will show basic information, current weather, and air quality of the city.

## Data from the API ##

- List of supported countries
- List of supported states in a country
- List of supported cities in a state
- data of specified city
	- Location
	- Time Stamp
	- Temperature
	- Humidity
	- Air Quality Index

## Extra Goals ##

- I also intend to learn how to build a responsive web with CSS 
  grid layout.
- I'm also aiming to have a information architect and user flow
  for this project.
- I'll also try to make calls to Google Maps API and see if I can 
  put a map on the background which will show where the city 
  specified by users is.
