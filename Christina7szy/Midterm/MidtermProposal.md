##Midterm Proposal

**Overall Idea**: A web app which allows the user to search for the artists they want to know about, and display a overview/infographic based on the Spotify API data.

**Project Breakdown**:

1. Deploy the app to the internet and build an user interface where anyone could log in with their Spotify account to use my app. 
2. Build a search interface where the user could search for artists and the information regarding the artist will be displayed. 
3. Adding CSS styling to the page displayed. 

**How do I take it to the Final Project**:

1. Iteration 1: In the artist overview/infographic page, the users is able to choose from the artistsâ€™ top tracks, and get a visualized analyze of the song. 
2. 1. Iteration 2: The web app will be a game in which the user is provided with information of the artist, and they will have to guess which artist it is.
