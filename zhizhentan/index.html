  <!-- If we import libraries to our code, we usually put it at the top  -->
  <!-- Download this file, and follow the code example from last night in class, to print out Star Wars characters to your HTML page. Bonus points for good CSS Styling (but you don't have to!)

At minimum, print out the following data points for each Star Wars character:

- name
- height
- eye_color
- gender

Instead of creating a `Book` class, just call it `Person`.
